# How to Costomize the high AQI message
1. Locate the AQI widget on your home screen.
2. Long-press the widget and tap on «Edit Widget».
3. Type any number in the «Parameter» field and hit enter.
4. Done. The high AQI message will be shown if the AQI is higher than the number you have entered in the «Parameter» field.

IMPORTANT: If you have more than one AQI widget on your home screen, repeat this process with each one.
IMPORTANT: Leaving the «Parameter» field empty or entering a negative number will trigger the notification every time the widget refreshes and got valid data. We do not recommend doing this.
# How to disable the high AQI message
Disabling this warning is currently not supportet.
Walkaround:
1. Locate the AQI widget on your home screen.
2. Long-press the widget and tap on «Edit Widget».
3. Type a very high number in the «Parameter» field (for example 10000) and hit enter.
4. Done. The high AQI message will be shown if the AQI is higher than the number you have entered in the «Parameter» field. Because you set this number to a very high value the message will most likely never trigger.

IMPORTANT: If you have more than one AQI widget on your home screen, repeat this process with each one.
IMPORTANT: Please don't disable notifications from the Scriptable-App.
